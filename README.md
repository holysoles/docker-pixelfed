# Pixelfed Docker Images

Forked from the [in-repo Dockerfiles](https://github.com/pixelfed/pixelfed/tree/dev/contrib/docker) primarily because I wanted nginx as the web daemon and something to publish to use in a Helm chart.

Tags are rebuilt daily so you should use the SHA hash if mutability concerns you.

Available tags:
- dev
- v0.11.4
